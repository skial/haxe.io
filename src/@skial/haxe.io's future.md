# Haxe.io's Future

The Haxe roundups have steadily been getting less frequent, from a weekly post to bi-monthly, then monthly and now more or less whenever I get time. The change was largely down to "discovering" content, which was around the time twitter got purchased _(3 years ago?)_ and the first user exodus happened and everyone was finding new platforms. Throw in _life stuff_ into the mix, the roundups obv got pushed further down my priority list.

### The future?

I think for the foreseeable future, no new roundups will be published to the [haxe.io](https://haxe.io) website. The website was [never completed](https://github.com/skial/haxe.io/issues/?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20-created%3A2025-08-07) and has had lots of rewrites over the [last 11 years](https://haxe.io/roundups/1/) that never got published.

Instead of using a home made static site generator and being 90%+ Haxe powered, I think its time to take this time to redesign the website, using commonly available tooling.

### When this going be done by?

Lets try and aim for 2026 :+1: ... :shrug: January. :shrug:

The roundup needs to get back onto my weekly schedule and I plan to get back to publishing the roundups monthly.

### Next steps

I've got a couple months worth of emails, content and issues to go through. I will also post an outline and my thoughts on what work needs doing to the site.

### Until then

Until Haxe.io is back up and running again, _if you haven’t already_, go join the [Haxe Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/0uEuWH3spjck73Lo), they regularly host Haxe _roundup_ roundups.

All the people behind the Haxe Discord servers success should be proud of what they've created & fostered, it is a great community resource. :clap:
