## Tell us about yourself?

1. _How did you get started in programming?_ and/or _How did you get started in your specific field?_

	>I actually started programming in a round about way; I really started by building my own electronic circuits from transistors, capacitors, resistors and other components re-purposed from things like broken VCRs that I used to buy in bulk from markets when I was a kid. Initially my main use for computers in that regard was actually to design circuits, but soon actually writing logic rather than building it became a far easier and more expressive medium - plus I was never particularly good at soldering, so not having burnt fingers all the time was another bonus.

	>I got a job straight out of college working for a small start up specialising in mobile applications, and this was way before mobiles were wide spread - were talking WindowsCE and PalmOS. After that job I started working in London for a medical company and finally decided to go freelance.

1. _What is your job?_
	>I still work for medical and pharmaceutical companies and so, by proxy, work for the NHS (National Health Service) but still in a freelance/contractor manner. 

    1. _Who do you work for?_
		>Even though I do work freelance one of the main companies I work for is INPS (In Practice Systems) which is part of the Cegedim group.

    2. _Do you use Haxe at work?_
		>Currently I dont, however, im hoping that this is something that will change in the coming future. 
  
    	1. _If you do, how?_
			2. _If not, are there any areas you want and/or can see Haxe fitting in perfectly?_

				>There are actually a few areas. The first is with using haxe to generate some of our front end javascript that we use in client facing portals and the such. As I'm sure I dont need to say, JS gets ugly very fast and haxe seems like a perfect way to generate this code from a clean and type safe codebase. Another would be for internal and external tools and GUI applications, this is of course a space I would like to see HaxeUI fill. 


## Out of the various Haxe IDE's available, which one(s) do you use?
>Most of my development I do on windows, therefore the IDE I use the most is FlashDevelop. Ive heard that you can use Eclipse and IntelliJ also and Ive been meaning to try them out (I use them alot for other non-haxe work), but honestly, I've never had a problem with FlashDevelop and thus never had a real need to look for alternatives.

1. _If you use more than one, why?_

	>On linux I use VSCode simply because FlashDevelop doesnt work there without Mono and VSCode seems to work just fine for what I need it to do. 
 

## What other software do you find vital while working with Haxe?
3. _Do you integrate any cloud based services while working with Haxe?_

	>I suppose, like most people, the main additional software is more in the form of libraries from haxelib which is, of course, an invaluable part of the Haxe eco-system. I think its probably my favourite part of Haxe really (as well as macros!). The abstract nature of Haxe means there is a little bit of everything in haxelib and it also sometimes feels that Haxe seems attract some of the most talented and "problem oriented" developers than any other community.    

	1. _And what problem do they solve for you?_

## What hardware you do you use?
> Recently bought a new computer:

> OS: Microsoft Windows 10 Home (x64)
> CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6700K CPU @ 4.00GHz (4.00GHz)
> Memory: 15.9 GiB Total
> Storage: 931.0 GiB
> Card: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970


## What problem does Haxe solve for you?
>Its as simple as its cross platform nature. There are of course alot of cross platform languages out there, but one that transpiles to so many native targets and doesnt use a VM is by far the most useful feature of Haxe to me. 

1. _What features of Haxe helped win you over?_
	 >Apart from cross platform its probably the syntax. Its very straight forward but also powerful and feels very mature.  
  
2. _Did you consider any other languages?_
	>Over the years, like most devs, Ive used a variety of languages and platforms - most of which either required different codebases or run inside a virtual machine (like Java)

 	1. _Why didn't you choose them?_

		>I use Java alot, its quite rare to not find a machine that doesnt have a Java VM on it (but it does happen) and for server side where you have control its not a huge deal. However, there is still issues with versions of VMs and bytecode you are running on them. Its certainly not the same thing as natively transpiling via C++ to a .exe. And lets just not talk about SWING. 

3. _What ticks you off about Haxe, if anything? Lack of feature? Something else?_

	>I dont know if I would catergorize it as "ticking me off", but im always surprised at how niche Haxe is. Ive spoken to alot of developers about Haxe and the response is usually the same: "I dont understand why this isnt well known" or "how isnt this a big thing" - I think it could be because, again, Haxe itself is so abstract it doesnt solve a specific problem, or set of problems, its far more generic which means there is no "killer app" if you will. 

	1. _How could they be fixed?_

		>No clue. More of an observation than a criticism. Its certainly felt like Haxe has been gaining momentum lately, and success stories like TiVo highlight this quite clearly. I also think that there is potential for libs *like* HaxeUI to lower the entry bar a little and make it a little easier for people to "dip thier toe" into the Haxe pool.  

## What compiler targets do you use?
>I think the main ones I havent used (or used much) are the php, Java and C# targets.  

1. _If you only use **one** target, why?_
2. _If you use more than one, for what reason?_
	> I would probably say that I use more than one target simply because that is what I needed haxe for initially. Building the same code for mobiles, browsers and desktop applications. Ive also looked at the solutions for using Haxe as a web server and needless to say, when haxeui.org gets a much needed make over it will be using one of these.

  1. _As a complete stack?_
  2. _As separate, target specific libraries?_
  3. _Anything else?_

## What platforms to do deploy to?
1. _Mobile, browser, embedded, server, etc_

>Primarily mobile, desktop & browser - So really, all of them. 

  
## What would you like to see added to the Haxe compiler?
>Im pretty interested in the new 'HL' target, which as far as I understand is a C target. I have no actual need for it per se but I think some interesting possibilities could come from it. 

  1. _A new target?_
  2. _A new feature?_ 
  3. _Any feature from another language?_

## What tips or resources would you recommend to a new Haxe user?
>Just get stuck in. Its a mature language and there is next to nothing to "trip you up". The syntax is familiar and the standard lib is more than rich enough. In fact, I see no reason at all that Haxe couldnt happily be used for some-ones first language on an educational level. 
>  

## What Haxe libraries and/or frameworks are you impressed by and use?
>Well, there is a plethora - I think all of the "render" libraries are impressive in their own way. The hxcpp lib is of course invaluable. Ufront also seems great.

## What problem would you like to see solved by a new or existing Haxe library?
>This probably goes without saying, but its UI. There are a number of libs available in the terms of either custom drawn components or externs to another lib, but I personally think in the spirit of haxe as a sort of "everything" type of language it would be nice to be able to pick it up and not really have to "choose" a UI system - I use "choose" tentatively as you would of course need to choose in some respect - but not having to rewrite an application half way through because you realise the jQuery externs werent the right choice to start with is more what I mean. A universal way to access different renderers or UI externs essentially.

## What is the best use of Haxe you've come across?
>Again this is really hard to quantify. I think its quite rare to find a bad use. The render / game frameworks all seem great. Ufront seems very well put together. Most extern libs seem pretty full. Pretty much everytime I read the news letter I come away going "hmmm, clever" or "hmmm, I like that"

## What do you think of the Haxe Foundation?
>I dont really think Im in a position to comment. I wouldnt know the first thing about running a "Foundation" or how to "spread Haxe across the lands". It could be my imagination or simply the fact that I've been using Haxe much longer now and so feel a little more "involved" in the community, but it feels to me that HF and Haxe in general have made pretty huge steps in garnering more general interest. Whether its a direct strategy or not.  

1. _Where have they excelled?_
2. _Areas you think they could improve?_

## Where do you get your inspiration?
>Coffee and extremely late nights / early mornings. :)

1. _Music?_
2. _Any specific books you strongly recommend?_
  1. _In general_
  2. _From or for your specific field_

## Which creatives/developers/artists (do you admire most? and/or impress you)?
> At the risk of sounding like a broken record it is again the people who write an maintain all these libs, the core compiler team, the mountains of help you can see littered over the net by the usual suspects. There is a real feeling of "can do" in the Haxe community I feel. As much as one of the "not so great" things about Haxe is its niche market, I suspect it is that very same thing that creates such a great community. Every addition, no matter how big or small has a real feeling of value - I doubt you would get that type of personal (or community) reward from writing (yet) another JavaScript primer.   

## What contributions are you proud of?
>I suppose this is easy one: I of course quite like HaxeUI - even more so with Version 2 around the corner. I also think the hxWidgets lib is a pretty useful addition in its own right. 

1. _Do you use them in your projects? Which?_ 
	>Version 2 of HaxeUI will certainly be featured in a few things Im currently mulling over. And hxWidgets itself forms the base of a backend for HaxeUI2

2. _Did your contributions bring you work opportunities?_
	>Yes. Ive worked on a number of projects that arent mine in a paid freelance or consultantcy capacity. Probably more importantly, I know of others who have written commercial products using HaxeUI and thats great to hear. 


## Tell us about your WWX talk?
>In a nutshell Im going to go over some of the things about version 1 of HaxeUI that essentially led to the total rewrite which will be version 2 and use that as a base to introduce version 2 and its features.

## What is the best part of WWX for you/are you looking forward too?
>Apart from the other talks which I watched last year and found interesting its probably as simple as putting faces to names. 


# Questions for all previous speakers/attendee's

1. Since your last WWX conference as a speaker or attendee, what developments are you impressed by?
	1. _What disappoints you, if anything?_

# Questions for Ian

1. What's it like working for the NHS _(UK's National Health Service)_?
>I really like it. Its challenging work on a grandiose scale, and since its medical nature there is a genuine feeling of accomplishment and importance. I also get the best of both worlds by being a contractor in that I dont get any of the negative aspects of "office politics" or "corporate away days" but maintain a professional and highly technical contact network all from my Barcelona base.    

2. HaxeUI, especially `v2`, has gained alot of attention for its native backends, whats been the biggest challenge for you in `v2`?
>Probably most of it. In order to add a new _backend_ I had to first learn how that target framework did things. Im no OpenGL expert and dont have any game writing experience or anything like that. So there was certainly a learning curve for pretty much each thing I knew I needed to implement. It was for that reason that I initially chose the 3 frameworks to target as being the most different from each other: OpenFL, Flambe and Kha.  
>Once those three were functional I was pretty confident that I had a pretty flexible candidate framework and new backends were "pretty easy" to support. Including native/hybrid ones.
>
>There was also the standard developer despair of "what am I even doing rewriting all of this" at 5am. Thankfully that seems to have subsided mostly now. 

3. What backend has been the biggest pain to develop for? Why?
>One of the more complex _backends_ was the pure HTML5 backend, it has no framework dependency at all and outputs a DOM tree (ie, not canvas drawn). Apart from the fact that there is no real "render" to speak of (from HaxeUIs perspective its just building DOM nodes), it was also that it was always going to be the backend that opened up haxe-core to native versions of components (as html supports them). I always knew it would take up the most time as it would lead to some core changes to the mechanics of haxeui-core. That all said and done however, its probably one of my favourite backends as the idea of writing a compelling rich web application without touching either HTML or JavaScript (but also not using canvases) still brings a smirk to my face - like Ive somehow run a marathon but did half of it in a taxi.    

4. What do you have planned for HaxeUI further down the road?
>The main thing is of course to simply get an alpha out. I was originally not going to release anything until the functionality of HaxeUI version 1 had been implemented in version 2. However, thats not really feasable and I have a "cut off point" in my head where there wont be any new components and all focus will go into a release. My main focus at the moment is to clean up and stabalise the API and get some documentation written. 
>
>I have some other pretty big ideas for tooling and application frameworks written around HaxeUI, but really these are just ideas at this point.
