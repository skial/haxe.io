I'm a sleep deprived programmer that really like working on tools, game programming and optimization.

## What hardware do you use?
Currently I use a desktop pc both at home and at work. For mobility I have a bootable 128GB USB 3 drive with Linux on it which I use to leech on whatever computer resource is available.

## What software do you use?
I've been finally able to completely switch to Linux last year. For Haxe development I use vim with the [vaxe] plugin.

## Where do you get your inspiration?
Working on Haxe at this moment is very exciting. Every day I think of a possible library / use and this inspires me to try, hack and keep helping the Haxe environment to grow.

## Which creatives/developers/artists do you admire most?
I'm very fortunate to work with people I admire, both at work as the haxe devs. The Haxe team for sure, I owe a lot of what I know from sneaking in and reading Nicolas' and Hugh's code.
As for artists, I really like cinema and I admire a lot Werner Herzog, Alejandro Jodorowsky, Peter Greenaway and many others. I also like horror flicks and monster movies.

## What contributions are you proud of?
For sure having done Haxe/Java and Haxe/C#. I use them daily at work and I feel very accomplished when I see it being useful for people.

## Did your contributions bring you work opportunities?
Yes. Though lately I've been looking for more time and less work.

## Do you use them in your projects?
Yes. Specially Haxe/Java, I've been using it to process large amounts of data and the results with regards to speed have been great!

## How did you get started with Haxe?
I found Haxe while looking for Flash optimizations so I could work with 3D. I quickly fell in love with it and ended up doing the port of Away3DLite to Haxe at that time.
When Flash stopped being popular, I felt very relieved to use Haxe.

## What problem does Haxe solve for you?
Haxe helps me feel secure that I will be able to solve a problem in the best way as possible. I really like the power that Haxe has to assimilate technologies.
Also Haxe macros help me think of new and simplified ways to solve a problem.

## What tips or resources would you recommend to a new Haxe user?
Use the source, Luke.

## What Haxe libraries are you impressed by?
[Stax] is a very sweet library. Deltaluca's [Nape] is also very awesome, both in speed as in features.
I like [Cocktail] a lot and I think it has the potential to be the only UI library we'll ever need. I may be a little biased but I really like the work that proletariat has done with [HUGS] :)

## What problem would you like to see solved by a new or existing Haxe library?
I'd really like to have a more extended Standard Library. Actually I'm slowly working on [taurine], which I plan to be able to fill that gap. One of the most difficult problems with haxe standard library is to deal with asynchronous / synchronous API differences.

## What is the best use of Haxe you've come across?
I think that NME/OpenFL is probably one of the best uses and demonstration of the power of Haxe.

## What do you see for the future for Haxe/OpenFL?
I hope to see a simplified version of OpenFL written as much as possible in Haxe itself (instead of using the cffi). This should make it much easier to port it and even embed it on other projects.

## Sell your wwx2014 session!
Unity is currently hands off the best 3D engine for indie game developers. The effort to be able to use Haxe with Unity was what made me start working on Haxe/C#. This is now a reality.

## What is the best part of wwx for you?
Even though I love technology I don't really like chatting via the internet. Getting to know the people behind handles and share ideas is really what motivates me.
