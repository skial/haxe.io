# Haxe Roundup â„– 173

[Michael Bickel][link 1] has a [new or alternative][link 2] blog which has some interesting screen shots of, what I assume are 3D tests cross compiling with OpenFL. Models seem to be created with Blender. Very impressive and way above my level of knowledge!

Maybe I've missed some blog post or tweet explaining what its all about, but the [OpenFL][link 3] have forked or created their own implementation of the Haxe C++ backend. Is it to have more control or is it to generate a more optimized output?

I would be surprised if this wasn't going to use Haxe in some *small* way, but [Shiro Games][link 4], which [Nicolas][link 5] co founded, have announced their new game [Until Dark][link 6] which is a *"multiplayer exploration game set in a huge and mysterious world"*.

[Lars][link 7], a big Haxe supporter, has pushed live the [Defender's Quest 2][link 8] website. The game uses Haxe, OpenFL and HaxeFlixel.

And not long after me saying Lar's is a big supporter of Haxe, pre-ordering of [Defender's Quest 2][link 9] will help subsidize the development of Nintendo and Sony OpenFL targets. [Original Tweet][link 10].

[Andy Moore][link 11] has posted [The Haxe community is awesome][link 12] which clears up the *"unfriendly community"* comment in his post [Haxe and Float initialization][link 13], which seems to have ruffled some feathers. Oops. *I've done it before*.

Andy has also released a video tutorial on how to [Install Haxe, OpenFL and SublimeText3 on OSX 10.9 Mavericks][link 14]. Awesome.

[Sam][link 15] released [Haxe DOM Bootstrap][link 16] which compliments his [Haxe DOM][link 17] library, by providing type safe components built with Twitter Bootstrap.

[Kha][link 18] is a complete alternative to OpenFL, which has recently been made open source under the MIT license. The original [announcement][link 19] says they have more to release, documentation and GUI tools. Kha *"supports more targets than OpenFL (like XNA, PlayStation Mobile, embedable standard Java and C#)"*. Checkout the [OpenFL comparision][link 20] for more info.
