# Haxe Roundup № 172

A new game made for Nickelodeon called Fairly Odd Parents - Scary God Parents which was created with [Flambe][link 1] by [Team Cooper][link 2]. They have also done a [small write up][link 3] about the project.

[Dan][link 4] has written *"a little article on a cool feature"* that he discovered in the latest [Haxe build][link 5], [Fake Enums][link 6].

Last [week][link 7] the [OpenFL team][link 8] announced premium accounts, well, they also announced the [OpenFL marketplace][link 9]. I just missed it.

How about a native OpenFL extension which allows you take photo's and record audio? [Josu Igoa][link 10] has released [CameraMic][link 11] to github.

The [git version][link 12] of [Tora][link 13] seems to have received an update that will allow it to work with/through? any [fcgi capable server][link 14]. So its no longer reliant on Apache. Tora is used at Motion-Twins for most, if not all, their games, so it is very efficient.

Do you remember back in issue [#169][link 15] that a experimental [Dart target][link 16] was created with no ocaml? It turns out [Heinz][link 17] is working on an experimental [Python target][link 18] using the same method. It currently only produces Python 3+, but it's still brilliant to see, I think, an easier way to create new targets.

[Nicolas][link 19] has released a new product, [CastleDB][link 20] - the structured static database. Unfortunately it currently needs Haxe 3.2 which is a [nightly build][link 21]. Even though it's created with Haxe, it's a standalone application using NodeJS and Webkit, storing data in JSON using the extension `cdb`. It only needs a v3.2 build for the Haxe integration.

And speaking of currently unavailable Haxe builds, Haxe 3.1.0 *unstable* should be available in a [few weeks][link 22].
