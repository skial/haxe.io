# Haxe Roundup № 146

[Joshua Granick][link 1] published a [blog post][link 2] titled *"Deploying C++ to JavaScript using Emscripten"*. Basically he's teasing NME folks with a new / alternative way to deploy to web.

As NME continues to move so fast, take a moment to read [Emrah Özer's][link 3] [article on why he moved][link 4] away from NME to ActionScript / Starling.

[Michael Baczynski][link 5], author of the amazing [polygonal][link 6] libraries has released his first Android game [Creamy Ice][link 7] using NME and his [ZZ][link 8] rendering library.

[Monster Loves You!][link 9] *"was entirely written in Haxe NME"* but only outputs to Flash for recompiling with Adobe Air for [Steam releases][link 10]. [Andy Moore][link 11] has [written][link 12] *"How to convert an AS3 ANE to Haxe"*.

Another game that's currently on Steam Greenlight, [Papers, Please][link 13], the *"dystopian document thriller"* created by [Lucas Pope][link 14] uses Haxe NME.

And the latest [Tourette Quest][link 15], the game that explores Tourette's Syndrome by [Lars Doucet][link 16], was created with Haxe Flixel.

Speaking of Haxe Flixel, it now has it's own [twitter account][link 17].

Over on google+, [Anthony Ogden][link 18] has released the [source code and art assets][link 19] for his One Game a Month [Fowl Metal Jacket][link 20] hosted on github.

With the release of [SoundAS][link 21] by [Shawn Blais][link 22], [Andreas Rønning][link 23] has already [ported it to Haxe][link 24] and it *"runs beautifully"*.
