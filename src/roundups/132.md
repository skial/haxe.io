[Juraj][link 1], author of the amazing [tinkerbell][link 2] library, has shown some [code for his new library tinx_node][link 3].

How about an [embeddable haxe http server][link 4]? Apparently all hacked together in one night! by [tong][link 5].

[Hugh][link 6], the original? creator of NME has the CPP target and NME running at 60fps on the Raspberry Pi!

With an Haxe 3 release candidate apparently due for the end of January / early February, Haxe SVN just got [Array comprehension][link 7].

[François][link 8] the developer behind [Strange Masks][link 9] thats built with NME, has [several new posts worth checking out][link 10], in [game video's][link 11], resources and [reviews][link 12].

[Christopher][link 13] has written about [NME Tiled : NME + TILED = &lt;3][link 14].

If your using FlashDevelop, then [checkout the handy templates][link 15] created by [Mark Knol][link 16].

If you use [Flambe][link 17], version 2.1 has been [released][link 18]!

And to end this weeks roundup, [Mike Cann][link 19] has updated [his Chrome extension PostToTumblr][link 20], which is used by 30k+ people. Awesome :D
