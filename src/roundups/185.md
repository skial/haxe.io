# Haxe Roundup № 185

The agency [Seven2][link 1] interactive have written [Awesome Things to Know About Flambe][link 2] over on the 14Four + Seven2 ThinkLabs blog. This is a great and concise overview of Flambe from a team who have been using Flambe for over a year.

[Allan Dowdeswell][link 3] continue's to help curate __THE__ list of [Haxe libraries][link 4]. There are now __17__ game frameworks to choose from!

And the latest addition to the list is the LÖVE port, named HÖVE by [Max][link 5] who has posted [Introducing HÖVE][link 6]. HÖVE depend's on OpenFL and uses OpenFL-Bitfive when targeting HTML5. There are some new and missing module's, but checkout the linked introduction for a detailed walk through.

Want to help Haxe in any way you can? How about voting for Haxe in [What is the Best Language that Compiles to JavaScript?][link 7].

Or if your interested in contributing to make OpenFL or Lime even better, [Joshua Granick][link 8] has setup a [space where everyone can stay in sync][link 9].

[Andreas Rønning][link 10] has posted an [alpha build][link 11] of Barrage, his BulletML for Haxe engine. Choose one of three preset's to get started and click run!

Andreas has also written on how Haxe has altered his coding style in [New code style tendencies][link 12].

I'll end with the article [Getting started with Game Development in Haxe][link 13] by [Sean O'Dowd][link 14], listing the best resource's and game engine's for Haxe. :D
