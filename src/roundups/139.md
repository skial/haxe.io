# Haxe Roundup № 139

<p>If you've checked out Haxe 3's [Abstract Types][link 1], take a look at this [short and simple example][link 2] by the macro master <a href="https://github.com/back2dos" >
Juraj Kirchheim</a>.</p>

[Andy Li][link 3] has written a [great article][link 4] called *"HXML tricks every Haxe user should know"*.

The Haxe Flixel tutorials keep coming, [this time showing off][link 5] the *"Mouse Interaction Manager"*. Touch events *should* work but they are currently untested.

[Alexander Hohlov][link 6] [tweeted][link 7] that Haxe Flixel's dev branch has *"initial support for texture atlas loading"* thanks to [Sergey Miryanov][link 8].

[Jaroslav Meloun][link 9] has ported Senocalur's TransformTool (Github: [jarnik / transformtool][link 10], License: *unknown*) to Haxe. Currently tested Flash and Neko targets.

[Tong][link 11] has [once again][link 12] had a late night - [porting nekoboot][link 13] to Haxe.

[François Nicaise][link 14] continues to [share his experience][link 15] from making [Strange Masks][link 16], this time for the *"NME folks"*, called *"Speed"*.

Grunt Haxe (Github: [Fintan / grunt-haxe][link 17], License: *MIT*) now works with GruntJS v0.4.

This is brilliant news, it [looks like BlackBerry is going to contribute to NME][link 18].

[Suat Eyrice][link 19] has created and open sourced NME Webview (Github: [SuatEyrice / NMEWebview][link 20], License: *unknown*) for NME's iOS and Android targets.

The IntelliJIDEA Haxe plugin has just been updated with [code folding][link 21].

Thanks to [Chris][link 22] and [ProG4mr][link 23] for sending news and links ;)

If any one has projects, tutorials, anything Haxe related - send me it :D
