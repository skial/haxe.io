# Haxe Roundup № 343

[Ian Harrigan][tw1] starts this week's roundup off with a [Developer Spotlight][l1]
interview over on the OpenFL blog, talking about his himself and HaxeUI.

Ian continues to tease us [on Twitter][l2] with upcoming HaxeUI features, with 
the latest sneak peak  of a _“**very** preliminary proof of concept backend
using waxe and **wxWidgets**”_!

Even though waxe is incomplete, Ian has [stated][l3] that his _“background is in
C++, so [he] is going to give waxe the once over [and] make it [have] a fuller
API”_.

The awesome [Andy Li][tw2] has spoken and promoted Haxe at this years
[PyCON HK][tw3] conference and has made his talks slides and notes [available][l4]
to all. As usual, I've provided a [backup][l5].

Andy has also released some graphics built using Python based on the data he
collected from his Haxe usage survey, so have a [quick cheeky peak][l6].

[Tomas Slusny][tw4] continues to work on and improve [Raxe][l7], an alternative
syntax for Haxe, inspired by Ruby, by adding _“Scala like traits to Raxe”_, with
a [helpful example][l8].

As Raxe is just an alternative syntax targeting Haxe, how about using some
of the latest HaxeLib releases with it?

- [hxsl `2.0.6`][l9]
- [nme `5.5.7`][l10]
- [HXCPP `3.2.193`][l11]
- [tink_concurrent `0.1.2`][l12]
- [overlap2d `0.0.1`][l13]

Even though not released to HaxeLib _yet?_, [Michel Käser][tw5] has updated
[hx-nanomsg][l14] enabling websocket and tcpmux protocols, with additional
fixes so it works with Haxe `3.2.0`. Michel has marked this repo and all other
repos as discontinued.

The overlap2d HaxeLib release is the runtime by the 
[Overlap2D editor][l15], an _“open minded editor for modern 2D games”_,
which loads and renders scene in HaxeFlixel. The Overlap2D team has also
released a video showcasing how quickly you can get 2D assets into HaxeFlixel.

[Lars Doucet][tw6] has [tweeted][l16] that the first HaxeFlixel titles targeting
the PS4 and PSVita using the in development console targets will hopefully
be launching the year or early next year.

A couple of games which will be able to take advantage of the consoles targets once
made publicly available are [Expansion][l17] by [Ben Merckx][tw7] and 
[Dusted Donut][l18] by [Justin][tw8].

Expansion is _“real-time space strategy game for mobile, desktop and browsers,
featuring an intuitive and simple interface for a flawless gaming experience”_.
You can play the [alpha build][l19] now. The game is built with OpenFL.

Dusted Donuts _“is an exploration game about space, loneliness, and rock people”_.
Justin has written [a brief dev update][l20] and [posted a demo build][l21], ready
for playtesting.

[Dustin Auxier][tw9] finished this week's roundup off with a particles 
[preview][l22] that uses OpenFL's `drawTriangles` which results in great 
performance.

Have a good week everyone!
