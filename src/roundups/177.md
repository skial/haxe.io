# Haxe Roundup № 177

The [Haxe IDE indiegogo project][link 1] came to an end last week and it exceeded its goal with the help of [FlashDevelop][link 2] and the [Haxe Foundation][link 3]!

[Lubos Lenco's][link 4] NME / OpenFL game [Castle Siege][link 5] has reached 100k installs on Google Play!

[Vadim][link 6] has released [HaxMin][link 7]. It is a minifier and obfuscator for the javascript output by Haxe. This is brilliant because `Reflect` will continue to work!!! Checkout the [Introducing: HaxMin][link 8] post for alot more details.

[Christopher][link 9] has released [openfl tiled][link 10] v3 which allow's developers to use the [TILED map editor][link 11].

[Alexander Kuzmenko][link 12] has added theme support to the dev branch of StablexUI. To get a good understanding check out his post [StablexUI : skins, defaults and themes][link 13]. I like the idea of themes being installable from `haxelib`. Nice and simple.

[Elliott Stoneham][link 14] has released the slide's for his talk [Adventures with go.tools/ssa][link 15] in which he converts [golang][link 16] to Haxe with his yet unreleased golang to Haxe compiler.

Check out [ionDrift][link 17] created by [b10b games][link 18] using OpenFL and awe6 targeting HTML5 2D canvas.

[Double Duck][link 19] have released [DDGameAnalytics][link 20], a OpenFL native extension for the [GameAnalytics][link 21] service.

[Andreas Rønning][link 22] has posted about his approach to a multi-threaded game loop in OpenFL. With it he is able to animate [11000 rotated and scaled bitmaps][link 23] via drawTiles which also includes the usual position updates.

And finally [it looks like OpenFL][link 24] will be targeting [Tizen][link 25].
