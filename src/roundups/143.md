# Haxe Roundup â„– 143

FlashDevelop has a new [dev build][link 1] available which has *smoother* Haxe completion - it is amazing.

With the release of [Hard-shell Hockey][link 2] to the Play Store, [Allan Bishop][link 3] has [written about his experience][link 4], about the good and bad when using NME.

[Simon Richardson][link 5] has [web workers][link 6] and Haxe *"running to make parallel function executions"* using his [actor library][link 7]. Also checkout the rest of his library [funk][link 8], it looks pretty sweet.

[Justin Donaldson][link 9] has released a *"simple bash script that he uses to switch between Haxe 2 and Haxe nightlies"*.

[Mutant Labs][link 10] apparently has *"the Leap Motion working in Haxe. Currently uses sockets, but getting nearer to a native extension"* for NME.

The [TOML][link 11], *"Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language"* is now supported by Haxe using the library [HaxeTOML][link 12]. Checkout the authors intro post [HaxeTOML - The TOML implementation in Haxe][link 13].

[Mike Stead][link 14] has released [HX Yaml][link 15] with *"JavaScript, Flash and Neko v2 targets currently supported"*.

[Sam MacPherson][link 16] has released [Haxe Concurrency][link 17] which contains *"thread safe data structures"*. It also contains a *"fully concurrent server"*.

Want to get a 67% - 125% performance boost __*on top*__ of NME's drawTiles? Well that's what the [StablexDL][link 18] library tests report.
