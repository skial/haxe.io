# Haxe Roundup № 151

The 3rd Haxe WWX has come and gone. From what I was able to watch and gleaned from twitter, some awesome announcements were made.

Probably the biggest announcement was from [Joshua Granick][link 1], who released [OpenFL][link 2] which replaces NME since Haxe 3.

If your new to OpenFL and NME, checkout the [Getting Started][link 3] article, or if your considering upgrading to Haxe 3 and OpenFL, take a look at [Transitioning to OpenFL][link 4]. And definitaly check the video [Joshua Granick - Special Announcement][link 5].

During the last week, [Andreas][link 6] has setup the [OpenFL &amp; NME][link 7] google+ community page, so OpenFL has a dedicated home of its own, already with 225 members.

This, technically, should be the biggest announcement, but people seem more interested in OpenFL, but this little thing called [Haxe 3][link 8] has been released. You can see all the [new features][link 9] in Haxe 3 from [Nicolas][link 10] wwx [slides][link 11].

Haxe will be [getting a new website][link 12], which will remove the old wiki and will add `api.haxe.org`, a Javadoc-like, searchable api reference which will integrate with the new haxelib. Fancy a [sneak peak][link 13]?

To help people get started faster with Haxe, more tooling will be created, starting with [Haxedit][link 14], a simple Haxe editor, base on Chrome Frame, so it will work across Windows, Linux, OSX, written in Haxe, *of course* and plugin based.

All Haxe development, issue reporting etc has now been moved to github under the [Haxe Foundation][link 15] account.

The last talk that I partially watched was *"Cocktail for game UI's"* by [Yannick][link 16] and [Raphaël][link 17]. Cocktail is an HTML and CSS rendering engine. As far as I understand, Cocktail renders HTML4 and CSS2.1 fully, with HTML5 and CSS3 features being actively worked on. It's an impressive undertaking. All I can say is try out the [demo][link 18].

[Knowledge Players][link 19] have written up their [overview of WWX 2013 [fr]][link 20]. They actually attended, so their article might be more accurate.

[Vadim][link 21] has been releasing some demo tweets of projects he's working on, a [scripting language][link 22] written in Haxe, possibly using [hxparse][link 23], an [animated preview][link 24] of a livecoding utility by [Dima][link 25] and two blog posts, [Haxe: Replacing NME / Browser][link 26] and [Haxe: Migrating For-loops][link 27].

[Philippe][link 28] has updated NME TileLayer with support for texture scale, allowing you to easily use different texture resolutions without hacks

[Lars][link 29] recently found a [kickstarter][link 30] project, Rhythos RPG Builder. It's *"an interesting RPG toolkit which is both Open Source and the engine runs in Haxe*”.

[John Watson][link 31] has released a [video and a couple of screenshots][link 32] of his game, Duel! Brilliant idea.
