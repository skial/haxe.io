# Haxe Roundup № 306

![wwx 2015 social](/img/305/wwx2015.png "WWX 2015 in Paris between 29th May and 1st June!")

The [Silex Labs][tw6] folks have [tweeted][l9] that they are looking for speakers 
for this years upcoming WWX2015 conference. If your interested, you should create
a pitch over on the Thaxe Force [mailing list][l10].

[Alex Koz][tw7] has also [announced][l11] he is looking for speakers for [DevGAMM][tw8] 
in Moscow, Russia on the 15th / 16th of May 2015.

[Philippe Elsass][tw1] from Massive Interactive has [stated][l1] that they are rewriting
the YouView UI, an internet TV service here in the UK, for SONY's next gen TV's
using Haxe and their Multi Screen Development Kit (MDK).

[David Mouton][tw16] from [Happy Technologies][tw17] has released [Heidi][l20] a
product personlization cloud service. Composed on two parts, a Saas backend and 
webapp, the [webapp][l21], plus mobile components are powered by Haxe with 
the Saas backend written in C#.

[Nicolas Cannasse][tw2] who's part of [Shiro Games][tw3] has released Evoland
onto [iOS][l2] and [Android][l3].

[François Nicaise][tw4] has released a [demo][l4] of his upcoming, work in progress
game, Better Human Consortium. The premise is that _“private data has been stolen 
by a malevolent company. You are a hacker. You need to find codes to log in their 
central server and free the data”_. François also has a [Patreon][l5] page, you should
support him if you can.

[Adi Reddy Mora][tw15] recently posted a link to a Haxe compiled [demo][l6] built on top
of Pixi.js, a 2D WebGL renderer, based on the famous BunnyMark performance
_benchmarketing_. I fell for it, the performance increase is amazing.

![harfbuzz lime openfl right to left](/img/306/harfbuzz.png "Right to Left text in Lime / OpenFL looks great by @DanielUranga")

[Slava Tretyak][tw5] has created a work in progress [particle emitter][l7] for OpenFL.
Slava has written [Particle Emitter for OpenFL][l8] which introduces you to his
implementation, some areas you should be aware of and how to install his library.

[Nico][tw9] has created his own toy [interpreter][l12] named VainLang, move a side Haxe.

[Game Popper][tw10] has created and released MAN-Haxe, available on
[Haxelib][l13] and [GitHub][l14], which provides a _“set of Maze and Noise 
algorithm classes that can generate 2D array or string maps”_.

[Creative Mage][tw11] has created [Movie Clip Renderer][l15], which does what it says,
which is _“render MovieClips to a BitmapData array. It works with nested movie 
clips, offsets in movie clips and more”_. Nice and simple.

[Tong][tw12] has created type definitions for [texgen.js][l16] called 
[texgen.hx][l17], which allows you to procedurally generate textures.

[Samuel Twidale][tw13] has created another extension. This time its an
[extension][l18] which brings AdMob support to iOS and Android for OpenFL. Its
also available from [Haxelib][l19].

I'll finish this weeks roundup off with the latest game from the [Puzzl][tw14]
team, Yummy Circus, an online multiplayer game built with OpenFL.
