This has been a long requested and it's finally arrived, [try.haxe.org][link 8] has been upgraded to Haxe 3, thanks to [Clément Charmet][link 9] for the work.

The [Kha framework][link 10] has had it's first community developed feature added, Tizen support, done by [Lubos Lenco][link 11].

And another alternative to OpenFL, but at the same time used by OpenFL, is the [Lime framework][link 12] which give's you a lightweight OpenGL framework for Haxe that works across Mac, Windows, Linux, Blackberry, HTML(WebGL), Android, iOS and more.
