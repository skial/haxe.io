[Tong][link 3] has updated the [Haxe][link 4] / [Haxelib][link 5] `bash` auto completion scripts for all the extra skilled people out there.

[Lubos][link 6] has released his new game [Pexeso][link 7], the *"beautiful memory game"* to the [Google Play store][link 8] with plans to add *"cross-platform online multiplayer using [Nuggeta][link 9] and [OpenFL][link 10]”*.

A new minor release of OpenFL is on [haxelib][link 11] *"with 64-bit Neko support for Mac and minor improvements to keep everything running smoothly"*.

[Dennis][link 12] has [written][link 13] about using gestures in OpenFL with the [roxlib][link 14] library which isn't dependent on any native features.
