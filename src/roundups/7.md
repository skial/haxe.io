# Haxe Roundup № 7

In the last week haXe has released a new version (2.06) with new features, NME 2.0 has been released with better performance and support for Android and there's already talk of haXe 3.0. There were plenty of interesting topics this week, but I had to keep some of them out from this post, you can find the rest at the [haXe mailing list][link 1].
