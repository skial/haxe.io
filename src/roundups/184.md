# Haxe Roundup № 184

[Peter Stefcek][link 1] has released the Haxe build for [genome2d][link 2] v1.0.235. Checkout the [changelog][link 3] for the details.

[Lubos Lenco][link 4] has released an awesome [3D demo][link 5] demonstrating the abilities of the [Kha framework][link 6]. Compiled to Javascript and rendered through WebGL.

[Thomas Uster][link 7] from [Proto Games][link 8] who are developing [Pakka Pets][link 9] currently on KickStarter has posted his first post on tigsource about using Haxe, OpenFL and Adobe Scout to create a [fast and lean game][link 10].

This has been a little difficult to get my head around, but [Heinz Hölzer][link 11] has been working on higher kinded types with the help of Simon Krajewski, one of the Haxe's core developer's.

You should definitely checkout the [announcement post][link 12] over on the mailing for examples and explanations, posted by Heinz and [Stephane][link 13].

And if you want to play with the experimental features, go download one of the [supplied compiler's][link 14] that Heinz has built for you.

[Vadim][link 15] continue's to make an amazing OpenFL HTML5 alternative, this time adding a fully Flash equivalent `BitmapData.noise()` into openfl-bitfive. Read how he [did it][link 16].

Friedrich of [Rat King Entertainment][link 17] has committed his [Phaser Haxe][link 18] binding's for everyone to enjoy! [Phaser][link 19] is a free and fast 2D game framework for making HTML5 games for desktop and mobile browsers, supporting `canvas` and `webGL`. Just in case you've never heard of it.

And to finish, over on the mailing list, Bruno Garcia has started working on [dts2haxe][link 20] which has the goal of mass converting the [Definitely Typed][link 21] repo.
