# Haxe Roundup â„– 131

[Florian][link 1] from [Black Goat Games][link 2] have released their Indie Speed Run game [Redneck Blackwater Bay Treasure Hunter][link 3]. Lets go and vote it up! Then play it :)

[Nicolas][link 4] is presenting Haxe at the [mloc.js][link 5] this February 14th - 16th in Budapest.

You've heard of [HxSL][link 6]? Then checkout the article on [using HxSL to create 2D filters/shaders][link 7].

With NME 3.5.2 already out, checkout this [post][link 8]. It talks about the upcoming paid services, the new features such as OpenGLView and a new project format.

How about some new libraries?

[Hoo][link 9] is a library that enables operator overloading in Haxe, also check out [hxop][link 10] as an alternative.

[Hx-async][link 11] is a library that makes async programming in Haxe easy. Take a look at the detailed [intro][link 12] post.

Now how about some job offerings, checkout the posts for [Massive Interactive][link 13] and [Game Pill][link 14].

[Grant Mathews][link 15] recently converted a code base of around 5000 line from ActionScript 3 to Haxe. [Here's what he learned][link 16].

Checkout the latest [development post][link 17] for [Strange Masks][link 18], the innovative puzzle game that blends concentration games with dungeon crawlers.

A couple of new tutorials have been released, [Getting started with Haxe, NME and FlashDevelop][link 19] and [Getting started with HaxeFlixel &amp; FlashDevelop][link 20].

[Functional or OOP?][link 21] What's your thoughts?

A potential new target for NME? [Ford releases an SDK for their cars][link 22] ;)
