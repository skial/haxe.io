# Haxe Roundup № 180

[Vadim][link 1] continue's to create interesting demo's, this time a [HTML5 Terraria profile viewer][link 2] which test's his recently added OpenFL-bitfive FileReference, combined with recent fixes to ByteArray which allow's you to port feature rich applications to HTML5.

Another from Vadim, a Haxe OpenFL Bitmap Font [implementation][link 3]. Kerning, align, data inlining and a few extras.

[OpenFL][link 4] has released a new article [OpenFL meets Lime][link 5]. You now have access to low level rendering, audio and input.

[Christopher Kaster][link 6] has released [openfl-tiled v0.3.1][link 7] to haxelib which add's isometric map support.

[Andy Li's][link 8] hard work improving the pygments library to highlight Haxe 3 correctly has found it's way to Github, so everything finally renders correctly!

[Justin Donaldson][link 9] has started a [Nominate/vote for your favorite Haxe library of 2013][link 10] thread over on google+. Go submit / vote for your favorite library!

[HaxeFlixel][link 11] are moving from their in house forum to using [google groups][link 12]. Go and join them!

And finally, I hope everyone has a Happy Holiday!
