# Haxe Roundup № 135

[NME 3.5.5][link 1] has been released, more of a maintenance release than anything, __but__ with Native and WebGL GLSL shader examples.

Two new UI libraries that all the NME folks should checkout :

[YAHUI][link 2] is *“a skinnable NME user interface designed to be used out the box and give a native user experience”*.

[StablexUI][link 3] is a *“macro driven UI engine for NME. All platforms are supported”*.

And one more for all the NME people, you can now add / edit tutorials and docs at [nme.io][link 4]!

[Evoland][link 5], the follow on from [Evoland Classic][link 6] has a [write-up on VentureBeat][link 7].

Another Haxe game that has received great publicity is [Strange Mask][link 8], which has been [reviewed by a well known French Magazine - Canard PC][link 9].

[Jordan][link 10] has a new release of [TJSON][link 11], the tolerant json parser.

[Jon Borgonia][link 12] is presenting at the [OUDL about Lua and Haxe][link 13] on February 18th.

[Flambe 2.2][link 14] has been released, fixing important [Flump][link 15] bugs, and now comes with an [experimental WebGL renderer][link 16]!

This is really awesome, [Tong][link 17] has a working [Native Client][link 18] build toolchain for HXCPP. You can get it [from github][link 19].

This is something that everyone __should__ keep an eye on, [Basis][link 20] which has *“the goal to provide cross platform access to native UI components”*.

Is [Haxe Memes][link 21] a sign of Haxe’s increasing popularity?
