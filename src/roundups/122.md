# Haxe Roundup â„– 122

A new release of [FlashDevelop][link 1] is out with improved NME and Haxe AIR support and numerous CSS, HTML5 and Javascript improvements.

[Pah Arif][link 2] has fixed an HXCPP Android bug on Linux with all the details on his [blog][link 3].

[Steeven Plu][link 4] created [Milady][link 5] in 48 hours, LudumDare Mode.

Another game [Make a Scene: Dinosaurs][link 6] is out now for the HP touchpad, made with NME.

Continuing with games, two interesting competitions are running this month, [Github Game Off][link 7] and [TIGSource's TIGCompo][link 8]. [Adrian][link 9] over at [Vigeo Games][link 10] shows a prototype for TIGCompo. Looks brilliant!

It looks like [Nicolas][link 11] is working on a [lightweight stage3d engine][link 12] for Haxe, which will have a [2D framework][link 13] on top of it soon.

This is pretty cool, a [3D renderer ENTIRELY in CSS3][link 14]. Check out the [demo][link 15], your likely need the latest Chrome or Firefox to view it.

[DynaLight][link 16] currently only Haxe/Flash is a Dynamic Lighting engine. The source is available from [github][link 17]. I forgot to put this in the [last roundup][link 18].

Slightly going off the Haxe topic, but with [WebRTC now live in Chrome v23][link 19] some pretty interesting demo's / apps can be created. Oh, Tongs [hx.html5][link 20] library has WebRTC type definitions.

And lastly, for everyone working on touch devices, [Responsive Navigation : Optimizing for Touch Devices][link 21] is __definitely__ worth reading.

For some time now, I been thinking of changing the format, so I based it on [Aaron T. Grogg's : Today's Readings][link 22].

Thoughts?
