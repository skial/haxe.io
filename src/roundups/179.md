And to go with the new OpenFL Tizen target, OpenFL are in [partnership with Tizen][link 9]. The partnership makes the SWF library free to all developers and financial incentives.

The Lime framework has also gotten a new logo on it's [website][link 10].

[Joshua Granick][link 11] has put out a [tweet][link 12] asking for part-time help to build a Neko web service or native extensions. Get in contact with him if your interested.

[Elliott Stoneham][link 13] has written a [follow-up post][link 14] to his [golang->ssa->haxe][link 15] slides.

[Andy Li][link 16] has successfully gotten TravisCI to test __all__ [10 Haxe targets][link 17]!

Last [week][link 18], [David Peek][link 19] showed the [Haxe compiler running on Android][link 20]. He has posted a [gist][link 21] for anyone wanting to following in his foot steps.
