# Haxe Roundup № 182

[Andreas Rønning][link 1] has released his work in progress variation of BulletML for Haxe game's called [Barrage][link 2].

Also, way back in [roundup 109][link 3],  Andreas released the teaser trailer for [Super Croissant Fighter][link 4]. It's going [to be][link 5] completed!

He has also posted over on [google+][link 6] some Haxe C++ gotcha's he has come across.

For those who haven't tried [Vadim's][link 7] [Terrasavr][link 8] that was featured in last week's [roundup][link 9], he has posted a [youtube video][link 10] showing it off.

[Joshua Granick][link 11] posted on the Haxe mailing list that the [OpenFL team are working][link 12] on more documentation for Lime and OpenFL. They also want to provide more communication in how pieces are connected, how each platform works and how you can help.

[Justin Donaldson][link 13] has updated [Vaxe][link 14] to support Lime and drops support for older NME/OpenFL build commands.

[Marc Weber][link 15] has created a Haxe [bitbucket community][link 16] which contains some useful code. I will leave the library descriptions to the [original post][link 17] on the mailing list as their are quite a few libraries. Check them out.

I love the pattern matching that was introduced in Haxe 3, but since it's introduction people have semi regularly been having problem's with Haxe v3 `switch` behavior vs Haxe v2.10 `switch` behavior . More information on the [topic][link 18] over on github. And here's a really good solution, bring back v2.10 `switch` behavior and [move pattern matching][link 19] to a new `match` keyword.

It looks like [UDP support][link 20] is coming to the standard Haxe library.

And for those Haxer's who use macro's, in the latest dev builds you can use `@:mergeBlock`. More [information][link 21] on the mailing list.
