Nape 2.0 is out! I didnt even know it had a [website][link 1].

[Castle Siege][link 2] by [Lubos Lenco][link 3] has won a prize in the [Samsung Smart App Challenge][link 4]!!

Checkout the video [Debugging HXCPP applications in IntelliJIDEA][link 7].

Something else thats looking awesome, the [new Evoland website][link 8] is now live!

[Florian Hofmann][link 9] has written a blog post on [how to use Air Native Extensions in Haxe][link 10]. Lets hope it can help [Andy Moore][link 11] get SteamWorks [working with his game][link 12].

[Greg Caldwell][link 13] shows a couple of [videos and more][link 14] on his partial port of Away3DLite for NME.

As Christmas approaches how about installing [Blitzen][link 15] or an [Advent Calender][link 16] both built with NME?

Not looking forward to Christmas, then maybe checkout [Justin's][link 17] javascript canvas experiment [Haxe Zebra][link 18].

With the [Github Game Off][link 19] challenge over, here are the games I could find :

[MrPushPull][link 20] by [ProG4mr][link 21]. The objective is to kill all the cats and turtles. Avoid getting killed by the turtles. [source][link 22].

[Push/Pull Factory][link 23] by [Gagege][link 24]. You and a friend/enemy are two government contracted hazardous-materials sorting robots. Orders for 3 deadly elements; Lithium, Plutonium, and Uranium, are coming in fast. It's up to you to fulfill those orders! [source][link 25].

[Save The Clones][link 26] by [Jacic][link 27]. When scientists cloned the newly discovered alien humanoids, they never suspected that the clones might not want to take part. [source][link 28].

And finishing off, [Joshua][link 29] shows a [sneak peak][link 30] at something he's working on, expect awesome.

*Update 6/12/12*

Flambe 2.0, the fast, expressive game engine has been released. As a major release it has breaking changes so read the [migration guide][link 31].

[Emiliano Angelini][link 32] has announced that his NME game [Sophies Drawings][link 33] will be available from Decemeber 12th for iOS. Go checkout the [trailer][link 34].

[Michal][link 35] has written about his experiences going from [Flash to NME][link 36] with his game Blocky. He explains the build process, asset management and more.

[Mihail][link 37] has announced a project he's working on, [Gameplay][link 38] neko and cpp bindings, the crossplatform 3D engine by BlackBerry. Read the [haxe mailing list post][link 39] for the full details.

Thanks to [ProG4mr][link 40] for emailing me about Github Game Off finishing and suggesting to do a mini roundup of games made with Haxe.
