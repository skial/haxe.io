# Haxe Roundup № 174

The [Haxe Foundation][link 1] has released their [second update][link 2] this year, what projects they are funding and the progress they have been making.

The [Haxe IDE][link 3] indiegogo project has released an update, with an [experimental branch][link 4] on github that allows you to create your own plugins. They have also created a [google+ page][link 5] and a [google groups][link 6] page for you all to stay up to date with them.

[TweetFight][link 7] - the ultimate social battle, a Flambe game [wins the FWA mobile award][link 8].

[Allan][link 9] has announced that the [Glory Framework][link 10] is now Haxe 3 and OpenFL compatible. Glory *"is a page based media framework, used for interactive e-books, adveture games or slide presentations*" and can *"rapidly convert a PSD layout into a format it understands*”.

[Dan][link 11] who *"decided to get familiar with Ocaml and Haxe source code"* has written a quick guide on how to [Build Haxe on Windows][link 12]. *I've haven't succeeded in recent months, but I'll have to try this*.

[Sébastien][link 13] has written a great post on [Bresenham magic][link 14] using Haxe, allowing ray casting, line of sight and path finding all from one algorithm.

The [OpenFL team][link 15] have finally [released v1.1][link 16]. Lots and lots of improvements, go read the post and comments. Well worth it.

This [comment][link 17] answers my question from [last week's roundup][link 18] of why they forked the CPP target. I wasn't far off.

*"As we have been responding to changes with Android and iOS tooling, and as we plan our steps forward in order to improve the experience, we feel that we need to have more control over the timing of releases and the tools surrounding the CPP build process. We have full intentions to keep CPP compatibility with HXCPP, while finding new ways to innovate and get fixes out to you, faster."*

Last week [Michal][link 19] released three posts, comparing [Neko cacheModule &amp; Tora share][link 20], [Chat Example using Tora Queue][link 21] and [Haxite - writing an entire site using Haxe][link 22]. They each contain valuable info.
