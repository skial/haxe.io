# Haxe Roundup № 161

[Grapefrukt][link 1] released [Rymdkapsel][link 2], written in Haxe, which is a strategy game *"where you take command of a space station and its minions"*, has a write-up in [theverge][link 3].

A new library, [protoc-gen-haxe][link 4], which is a [Protocol Buffers][link 5] implementation in Haxe and it's more powerful than [protohx][link 6], fully [endorsed][link 7] by the `protohx` author.

OpenFL has launched their [professional services][link 8], currently providing app marketing, app publishing and enterprise support.

[Lars][link 9] has released a new library, [FireTongue][link 10], *brilliant name by the way*, which is a translation / localization framework and adapted from [Defender's Quest][link 11] code. It already has an HaxeFlixel [demo][link 12]!

[Ronan][link 13] has released [openfl-stage3d][link 14], a library that implements stage3d on top of OpenFL using GLSL.

And if your in the San Francisco Bay Area, then join the [Haxe group][link 15]!
