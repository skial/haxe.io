# Haxe Roundup â„– 123

[Adrian][link 1] has released a [second][link 2] and [third][link 3] videos for his TIGSource [TIGCompo][link 4] game, Pole Vaultage that I talked about in last weeks [roundup][link 5].

As the game library behind Pole Vaultage, [HaxeFlixel][link 6] v1.07 has been released and is now available from [haxelib][link 7]. Check out the [changelog][link 8] for full details.

[Another Game Engine][link 9] has added Box2D support with a [blog post][link 10] on how to get started.

[Joshua][link 11] has been working on improving the performance of NME's HTML5 target by implementing *drawTiles* and *requestAnimationFrame*, check out the [RunnerMark][link 12] and [PirateMark][link 13] tests.

As an alternative way of targeting HTML5 with Haxe, [Fintan][link 14] has recently updated the [EaselJS externs][link 15] to [v0.5.0][link 16].

Also [Double Duck Studio][link 17] explain on their [blog][link 18] why they have switched to Haxe for HTML5 games.

One Haxe library you should probably keep an eye on, [Flambe][link 19], has been updated to v1.5 and is available from [haxelib][link 20]. Check out the [announcement][link 21] for more info.

[Justin][link 22] shows two demo's, [rollover][link 23] and [spin][link 24], which will part of a tutorial, using no special libraries, just plain HaxeJS.

It looks like someone has ported the AS3 [Ash][link 25] entity framework to Haxe, aptly named [Ash-Haxe][link 26].

[Mockatoo][link 27] v1.3.0 has been released to [haxelib][link 28]. It provides a simplified, smarter, macro enhanced API using Haxe's *using* mixin. Check out the [examples][link 29] over at the Haxe mailing list on how to use the new API.

And with [browser.hx][link 30] planned to replace the old HaxeJS type definitions in Haxe3, check out [JavaScript APIs you've never heard of (*and some you have*)][link 31]. Also use a library like [Detox][link 32] to help smooth over the Dom API.

I've had decent feedback towards the new format, so I'll continue with it.

Also what are your thoughts towards me dropping in the occasional non Haxe related links, for instance [JavaScript APIs you've never heard of (*and some you have*)][link 33] which is posted above?
