# Haxe Roundup № 189

[Lugludum][link 1], an indie game studio, have released the [Spriter Haxe Engine library][link 2] so, you know, can use [Spriter 2D][link 3]. It appears to only depend on OpenFL.

[Vadim][link 4] has implemented [full mouse events support][link 5] in `openfl-bitfive`, the alternative OpenFL HTML5 engine. He has also written about implementing [`flash.net.URLVariables` for OpenFL-bitfive][link 6].

[Lars Doucet][link 7] tweeted a [picture][link 8] of FlashDevelop debugging a CPP Haxe generated program.

Huge thanks go to [Damjan Cvetko][link 9] who connected FlashDevelop and the [HxDebugger][link 10] together. He has also written [How to test the FlashDevelop Haxe CPP debugger][link 11].

The [OpenFL][link 12] team have refreshed their [website][link 13] and their [showcase][link 14] with 70 titles for desktop, mobile, web and consoles.

[Ipsilion Developments][link 15] have released an OpenFL iOS and Android extension [GetImagExt][link 16] which allows you to get the full path of an image from the camera or gallery.

[Dan Korostelev][link 17] has written an interesting post on the [latest Haxe feature, `@:genericBuild`][link 18] and how him and his team are using `@:genericBuild` in their project.

[Michael Bickel][link 19] is moving fast with the Foo3D development, this week adding a new logo, documentation and website which can all be found at [foo3d.developium.net/][link 20].

[Michal Korman][link 21] has released his OpenFL iOS and Android [AdMob extension][link 22].

[Jacob White][link 23] has written [Write Once, Publish Everywhere with HaxePunk: Making a Game][link 24] for [tuts+][link 25].

[Boyan Ololoevich][link 26] has written [Haxe 3 Tutorials: Submit your library to `haxelib`][link 27], which is clear and to the point.

And to finish up, [Onat Baş][link 28] has written about [External Asset Usage in BabylonHx][link 29].
