# Haxe Roundup № 136

Haxe 3 RC has had its [roadmap published][link 1]. You have until the 17th to submit new features, with the release aiming for the 24th of Feburary.

And for those of you who want to dive into the new features of Haxe 3, checkout the [manual][link 2] which is being updated regularly as the release date closes in.

[Steve McIntyre][link 3] has written a *"no-fluff guide on how to [set up Haxe and NME in FlashDevelop][link 4]”*.

Not on windows, thinking of using Sublime Text? Well [Varomix DaGreit][link 5] has posted a [video tutorial][link 6] on how to get sublime setup with Haxe and HaxeFlixel.

Maybe you use Vim, then take a look at [Justin Donaldson's][link 7] [Vaxe][link 8] *"a modern, modular vim mode for Haxe"*, which recently got support for NME projects.

[François Nicaise][link 9] has posted a new article about his experience publishing Strange Masks called [My Indie Nightmare, publishing Multi OS Games Part 2][link 10].

If you use [HaxeFlixel][link 11], 9 slice scaling has been added to [Lars Doucet's][link 12] personal [UI library][link 13]. You can see a [screen shot][link 14] of the UI library in use.

Theres also a new [video tutorial][link 15] about hacking the HaxeFlixel preloader.

[Nick Holder][link 16] has written a post [about creating Tiny Text Worlds][link 17], his prototype of a text adventure engine.

Do you remember from [last week's roundup][link 18], [StablexUI][link 19], [YAHUI][link 20] and [Basis][link 21]? Well another UI library has been discovered, [Guise][link 22] which is *"a GUI library for Haxe supporting native and non-native controls"* written by [Tom Byrne][link 23].
