# Haxe Roundup № 141

[Florian Hofmann][link 1], one of three from [Black Goat Games][link 2] will be presenting Haxe and NME at the next [Indie Outpost][link 3] event happening on April 17th.

[Erik Escoffier][link 4] has ported a [delaunay triangulation][link 5] library to Haxe, with a pretty [cool demo][link 6]. [Poly2Trihx][link 7] is the Haxe port of the [poly2tri][link 8].

Apparently a small experiment, [Franco Ponticelli][link 9] has created [livehaxe][link 10], an *"automatic compiler for Haxe and other tools"*, it *"monitors the files in your project and regens the output whenever it detects a change."* Very cool.

Maybe it could become part of the [new haxelib][link 11] that's under development, maybe as a `haxelib watch` command?

[Andy Li][link 12] has written another [excellent post][link 13] on getting *"automated unit testing for Haxe projects"* working with [Travis-CI][link 14].

*"Hello, I'm a popcorn fractal…"* by [Nicolas Barradeau][link 15] using NME, exported to HTML5. Watch [popcorn][link 16].

[Adrian][link 17] has [Pole Vaultage][link 18] *"merrily hum along on Android. There's no second player and jump control is easier (frustration level below 9000)"*. [Watch][link 19] over on youtube.

[Genome2D][link 20], the *"Stage3D GPU accelerated 2D engine"* is [coming to Haxe][link 21]! Apparently it has *"increased performance of up to 400% with at least 100%"* and *"the possibility of HTML5 deployment later on"*.

A [new tutorial][link 22] on how to use [HyperTouch][link 23], the de facto native Android and iOS touch library, with HaxeFlixel.

If you have ever wondered who is part of the NME team, well wonder no longer and [meet the team][link 24].
