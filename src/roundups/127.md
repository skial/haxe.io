# Haxe Roundup № 127

Ludum Dare 25 is this weekend, and [Adrien][link 1] and [Nicolas][link 2] are taking part. Anyone else?

[Tommislav][link 3] has written up a quick blog post [about preparing for Ludum Dare][link 4], with demo and source code, built with NME.

With Haxe 3 getting closer to release, the new and much improved HTML5 API has [landed in haxe nightly builds][link 5]. And Andy Li has already created a Haxe 3 branch of [jQueryExtern][link 6].

Also Haxe 3 nightly builds now have [pattern matching][link 7], which still needs testing and is hidden behind a flag.

[Zeflasher][link 8] has written a blog post on [Linux, Haxe, NME and IntelliJ][link 9] explaining the quickest way to get setup.

From last [weeks roundup][link 10], [Emiliano][link 11] has released [Sophie's Drawings][link 12] built with Haxe NME, to the [App Store][link 13].

Also really cool, [App developer at 14][link 14] who's using Haxe to create cross-platform games.

[Nicolas][link 15] has posted a short post over at Google+ about HxSL, [the Haxe Shader Language][link 16].

If your into Pokémon as well as Haxe, then you can get the Chrome extension for searching Pokémon info built by [Abraham Vázquez R][link 17].

Also from the Haxe+ page, join another place for Haxers, the [Haxe+ Community][link 18], already with <s>265</s> 280 members in just a few days.

[Shiro Games][link 19] shows us their [monster concepts][link 20] for Evoland.

And finally two un/related posts [Github's CSS Performance][link 21] improvements and [Why We’re Pivoting from Mobile-first to Web-first][link 22], both packed with useful info.
