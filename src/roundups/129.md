# Haxe Roundup â„– 129

I hope everyone has had a Merry Christmas!

HaxeNME has released [NME 3.5.0][link 1] just in time for Christmas, mainly focusing on HTML5 compatibility.

[Nicolas][link 2] has written about a project he has been working on [H3D/H2D][link 3] which is a generalistic low level 3D engine that wraps and abstracts the Flash Stage3D API, which integrates well with the [HxSL shader engine][link 4] v2.

[Michael][link 5] tweeted about his new library [zz][link 6], the crossplatform 2D rendering library.

[Tong][link 7] has release another library, [chrome.app][link 8], Haxe/javascript extern definitions for [packaged chrome apps][link 9].

[Laurent][link 10] has written about getting [Gamepad support in Flash via HTML5][link 11] with Haxe.

On the mailing list, [Jason][link 12] has as a Christmas gift, released two libraries [hxrandom][link 13] and [PBKDF2][link 14], a password hashing algorithm.

Also [Mihail][link 15] has released [hx-gameplay][link 16], which is also on haxelib. He has also written a [basic manual][link 17] to get started.

And finally, I wish everyone a happy new year!
