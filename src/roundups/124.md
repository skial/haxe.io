# Haxe Roundup â„– 124

The biggest news in the last week, the [Haxe Foundation is on!][link 1]. Follow the foundation on twitter [@Haxe.org][link 2].

[Nicolas][link 3] has written a little over at his [blog][link 4].

[Andy Li][link 5] is trying to improve, that is rewrite, the Haxe lexer that Github uses for it syntax highlighting, all I can say is good luck!

[Daniel Fedor][link 6] has written a [NME follow up][link 7] to his [NME First Impressions][link 8] post that he wrote at the beginning of month. Great post on what went right and wrong for him.

[Joshua Granick][link 9] has released [Actuate v1.5][link 10], the tween library, which now has Bezier tweens. And as usual he has post a clear and concise [blog post][link 11] on how it all works. Oh, he's also released updates for [spritesheet][link 12] and [swf][link 13] libraries. <img width="18" height="18" src="https://raw.github.com/github/gemoji/master/images/emoji/metal.png/" title="awesome"/>

Wait, there's more, [Joshua][link 14] has also written about the [performance of NME's HTML5 target][link 15] with the help of RunnerMark. He's also thrown together a [CreateJS][link 16] vs [NME][link 17] examples.

Continuing with awesome libraries, [Michael Baczynski][link 18] has released Polygonal v1.24, with [improved sprintf][link 19] using macros thanks to [Zachary Dremann][link 20].

[Flinthx][link 21] is a direct port of the AS3 [Flint particle engine][link 22] to Haxe NME.

Not related, but still cool, [Blue112][link 23] has posted a [little particle generator][link 24] built with Haxe, with [source][link 25].

A new NME game, [Peg Puzzle: Shapes][link 26] has been released for Blackberry App World by [Pulse Web Design][link 27].

Another game released for Blackberry, iOS and Android is [Arkeon][link 28].

Take a look at this game in the making that's inspired by Worms, called [Diggin' Blokes][link 29] by [Tom Platten-Higgens][link 30] using Haxe NME.

Also another game in the making, lives up to its name [Strange Masks][link 31]. Its built with Haxe NME. Check out the details [posted over on the mailing list][link 32].

Last week, [Adrien][link 33] added Box2D support to [AGE][link 34], but this week he has added Nape support, check out the detailed post on how to use [Nape with AGE][link 35].

Also check out this project I was emailed, [Version Spaces Algorithm][link 36] for Haxe js, cpp and java. The project page describes it better than I can. I think I should probably read the e-book [Algorithms][link 37] to help me understand it. <img src="https://raw.github.com/github/gemoji/master/images/emoji/unicode/1f601.png" width="16" height="16" title="grin"/>
