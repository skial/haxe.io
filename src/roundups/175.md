# Haxe Roundup № 175

[Ido][link 1] has released on bitbucket his [Pixi.js extern's][link 2] so you can get all the awesomeness from using Haxe on top of Pixi.js!

[FlashDevelop][link 3] 4.5 is out with some major improvements around Haxe and OpenFL support. Love it.

[Kha][link 4], the OpenFL alternative, now has a [google+ community][link 5] page. Go and join! Their [documentation][link 6] is slowly coming together.

[Jason][link 7] has written a [Super Quick Haxe Abstracts Example][link 8] which demonstrates their simple side. When your ready, take a look at some of the more [advanced features][link 9] Haxe abstracts have to offer. Be careful as it's far too easy to abuse their features.

And talking of advanced abstract features, how about a tutorial on [multi-type abstracts][link 10] by [Dan][link 11].

[Alexander][link 12] has posted a short post on how to fix the OpenFL 1.1 linux error [Could not initialize SDL : No available video device][link 13].

The first, new, [Haxe Hangout][link 14] took place last Thursday in the Haxe irc channel. You can read the [irc logs][link 15] to keep up. Just search for `[16:01:01] &lt;fponticelli> it is time! :)` to find the start.

And let's finish with that [Adrian][link 16] has published the [source code][link 17] for Pole Vaultage!, a frustratingly good game, to github.
