# Haxe Roundup № 183

Let's start this roundup with something awesome.

[Greg Caldwell][link 1] has posted a [video][link 2] of his early in-progress port of Away3D v4.1 to OpenFL built on top of [openfl-stage3d][link 3]! The video show's three native demo's working on the iPad, the Nexus 7, the Huawei U8510 and the BlackBerry Playbook.

Check out Greg's [OpenFL port of Away3D][link 4] post discussing the change's he faced since starting it over a year ago.

And at the same time *another* port of Away3D appears! Greg's is focused on native support, while [longde123][link 5] [port][link 6] target's WebGL and Flash.

Then there's [native3d][link 7] by [lizhi][link 8] which say's it's *"a simple GPU accelerated graphics engine written in Haxe"*. The five demo's all targeting Flash are [Bullet 3D][link 9], [Sponza 3D][link 10], [Skeleton 3D][link 11] and [Tank 2D][link 12].

[Jason O'Neil][link 13] has posted how to [Accept either String or Int without resorting to Dynamic][link 14] using abstract types, while still having the compiler type check everything is correct. Checkout the live example over at [try.haxe.org][link 15].

[Nicolas Cannasse][link 16] has added ribbon trails to [h3d][link 17]. Checkout the [screenshot][link 18] of the h3d particles editor. *An editor!*

He has also [shared the first screens][link 19] of his game studio's next game UntilDark.

[Mark Knol][link 20] has posted a [Flambe][link 21] [code snippet][link 22] which allows you to control the overall speed when using the `SpeedAdjuster` component.

Also take the time to read Mark's [Haxe Macro's: Code Completion for everything][link 23] post. If you have never used macro's - this post is brilliant as it set's a clear goal and take's you through step by step on what to do and how everything works.

[Max][link 24] is porting [Love2D][link 25] to Haxe called HÖVE with a *nomnom* demo already targeting [HTML5][link 26] and [Flash][link 27]. I assume it's built on top of OpenFL. He already has an awesome response from people on reddit [r/love2d][link 28].

On KickStarter, with it's goal almost met, is a cute Haxe game created by [Proto Games][link 29] called [Pakka Pets][link 30]. It's *"a new pet adventure game for your phone. Discover rare evolution's, decorate, explore different worlds &amp; fulfill your pet's destiny!"*.

And to finish with awesome - [Tong][link 31] has released [hxmpp v0.4.13][link 32] to haxelib.
