# Haxe Roundup № 188

[Dan Korostelev][link 1] has shed some light in his post [Using Haxe Macros as syntax-tolerant, position aware json parser][link 2] in which him and his team use the Haxe compiler to validate and generate strict json using Haxe macros for their game settings.

[Christopher Kaster][link 3] has released `openfl-tiled` v0.4.1. This update includes improved Flash performance, supports transparent colours and several new samples. Checkout the [changelog][link 4] for the full details.

[Michael Bickel][link 5] has posted another [screen shot][link 6] of [foo3D][link 7]. This time its running on HTML5, Flash, Windows, Linux and OSX successfully on a range of devices.

[HaxePunk][link 8] have released v2.5.1 which includes improvements to the HaxePunk core, Ouya game pad corrections, BitmapText fixes. Checkout the [changelog][link 9] for the full details.

In last weeks roundup [№ 187][link 10], it was announced that [Addicting Game's][link 11] are actively looking for games written with [Flambe][link 12]. This week sees the creation of the [Flambe Showcase][link 13] featuring over 80 games that have been created for companies like Nickelodeon, Disney and Toyota.

[Shane Johnson][link 14] has written about [The Awesome AWE6 Haxe Game Framework][link 15] in which he gives his opinion on why [awe6][link 16] is the best game framework available to Haxe developers.

[Renaud Bardet][link 17] posted over on the mailing list Haxe [externs][link 18] for Google's Chromecast library. It current only has definitions for a host application and currently targets Haxe/js.

[Simon Krajewski][link 19], a core contributor to the Haxe compiler, has created `@:genericBuild` which works similar to `@:build` but per-instance and the underlying build macro has access to all type parameters. The use cases from the [pull request][link 20] allow for replicating [`@:generic`][link 21] behavior and [wrapping a given type][link 22] in a read-only structure. This is a very exciting addition to Haxe macros and would [make a lot of ideas][link 23] much easier to implement.
