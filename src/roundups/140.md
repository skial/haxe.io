# Haxe Roundup № 140

HaxePunk [seems to be getting faster][link 1] according its BunnyMark port, with 5000 bunnies at 30+ fps. All based on the latest dev branch.

And it [seems][link 2] both the lead devs of HaxeFlixel and HaxePunk, [Alexander Hohlov][link 3] and [Matt Tuttle][link 4], respectively, might be planning on combining efforts to bring more speed to both projects.

The in progress [Objective-C target][link 5] has successful built the NME PiratePig demo. Head over to the [mailing list][link 6] for a better description and a picture!

Zest3D, the cross platform 3D engine for Ouya, iOS, Android, BlackBerry, PC, Mac and more [*"will be coming to Haxe soon"*][link 7].

[Lars Doucet][link 8] posted over at HaxeFlixel's forum how he has [*"Visual C++ debugging the CPP target"*][link 9] working, and for the adventurous people, the [project files][link 10].

How about this for a discussion, [Andreas Rønning][link 11] talks about how he is *"baffled and frankly a little disappointed in the lack of support for Haxe NME among Flash Developers"*, their reaction to Loom, *"issues with Unity3D's 2D performance"* and [more][link 12]. Take some time to read all of the <s>69</s> 70 comments.

This looks crazy, [NME WorldBuilder][link 13] the *"ultimate tool for making crossplatform games"* and with a huge feature list. <s>While NME [looks down][link 14]</s>, checkout the [youtube video][link 15] for 14 minutes of Nape goodness.

Theres one more NME UI framework to add to the list, [Zajac][link 16] which provides the *"ability for styling over CSS"*, supported targets are CPP, Neko and Flash and its been tested on iOS, Android, BlackBerry, Windows and Flash.

[StablexUI][link 17], one of the first? NME UI frameworks, is now able to [create loops in xml][link 18]. Also a new sample game has been released, [Ladybird][link 19], where all the objects are StablexUI widgets.

This is bound to be useful, [protohx][link 20] a *"crossplatform implementation of Google's Protocol Buffers"* has been released on [haxelib][link 21].

With Haxe 3 possibly being released at the end of April, [the future of haxelib has come up][link 22], so it's a good time to put your ideas forward. [Jason O'Neil][link 23] has received the Haxe Foundations approval to take charge.There's also a [road map][link 24] for the new Haxelib.

[This looks awesome][link 25], planetize.me, the 3D space simulation game, using Haxe PHP and Flare3D.

Thanks to those who emailed me updates, articles etc. More please!
