# Haxe Roundup № 176

Remember that hit success OpenFL game made by [grapefrukt][link 1] called rymdkapsel? It's in the latest [Humble Mobile Bundle][link 2]!?!?! Congrats on the achievement unlock.

And [Papers, Please][link 3] by [Lucas Pope][link 4] has been nominated for the best indie pc game in the [VGX 2013 awards][link 5]!

[Super Cute Force][link 6] made by [godjam][link 7] has been released, created with Haxe and [Flambe][link 8]. Checkout the introduction post [Here comes a new game : Super Cute Force][link 9].

[Joshua][link 10] lead dev of the OpenFL team has [tweeted][link 11] asking for *"25 apps to prove a new OpenFL target"*. Oooh - interesting…

During a mailing list conversation about *for loops*, [this][link 12] became the only interesting part of the conversation. It also shows just how far macro's have come.

Credit goes to [Simon][link 13] who actually added pattern matching to Haxe 3 and has improved macros immensely. Also thanks to [David][link 14] for actually posting it.

Macro Reification + Pattern Matching = Magic.

Now how about some [bunnies faster than light][link 15]?

[Sam][link 16] has written about using [Tora behind Nginx][link 17]. We need more server side articles!

[Adrian][link 18] has released a [mega devlog on Crate Collector][link 19]!

Static field inheritance in Haxe. I think this has been debated on the mailing list a few time's in the past and always been a firm no. Well, let's just use macro's to get what we want - [Alexander][link 20] has [static field inheritance working in Haxe][link 21].

[Hugh][link 22] creator of the C++ target has released [HURTS][link 23], the Haxe Ultimate Remoting and Trusting Server.

*"This a very simple server designed to allow rapid development of web services (not web pages) using a neko backend on shared hosting.*

*The idea is that you write your Haxe programs on your local machine and generate the .n file.  You then use the client program to send the compiled file to the server, where it is run and you can read back the ascii/binary output in whatever format you like. Since you control both ends of this service you can use whatever protocol you like.*

*You have a shared secret on the client and server to prevent malicious scripts being sent to your server”*.

And finally, remember that secret C target I mentioned awhile ago - it suddenly turned up on github. Go check it out at the [haxe-genc][link 24] repo.
