# Haxe Roundup № 145

The upcoming [WWX][link 1] event will have [Juraj][link 2] talking about macros and [Valerie's][link 3] [talk is titled][link 4] *"Storytelling with data and Haxe/Neko"*.

[Joshua Granick][link 5] has released a [demo of Pirate Pigs][link 6] compiled to WebGL. It looks like it's compiled through [emscripten][link 7], the *"LLVM to JavaScript compiler"*.

[Lubos Lenco][link 8], creator of [Castle Siege][link 9], has [listed the steps][link 10] it takes to get your NME app into the Mac App Store.

[Jason O'Neil][link 11] has [written][link 12] a really in-depth introduction to the *"new Map syntax in Haxe 3"*.

[Adrian][link 13] of [Vigeo Games][link 14] has written about the progress of [Crate Collector][link 15]. Turns out live streaming his dev sessions *"was a great motivator"* and helped *"keep the slack down to minimum"*. Pretty useful idea for those of us that get easily side tracked.

Now, I think this is pretty awesome. [Eugene Veretennikov][link 16], creator of [Protohx][link 17] has [recorded][link 18] his network [demo][link 19] working seamlessly across HTML5, Linux, Android, Flash, Neko and NodeJS.

So we have an in-progress [Objective-C target][link 20], talk of a [python target][link 21], a possible [Lua target][link 22], and now we have an in-progress [Rust target][link 23]. [Rust][link 24] *"is a curly-brace, block-structured expression language"* by Mozilla.

[LoudoWeb][link 25] has released their [new game][link 26] created with Haxe, Awe6 and ASWing.

[Parveen Kumar][link 27] has [written][link 28] a *"Review of Haxe NME for cross platform mobile game development"*, talking about its good and bad points.
